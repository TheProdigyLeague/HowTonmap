"We need to design a new way to iterate over host specifications (i.e., different than nexthost). Because the new host discovery code is sometimes going to want whole netblocks and sometimes individual hosts. So I'm thinking of a two-stage model, where the iterator will receive (parsed) specifications like AAAA::1/48, and then it can decide whether to further iterate that into individual addresses, or pass the block off to some specialized discovery routine."

1.) as a template for new scripts.  Users instead seem to pick a script that is most similar to the one they want to write and start with that.  
2.) As a way to learn more about the format of an NSE script.  Users instead seem to use our documentation (https://nmap.org/book/nse-script-format.html).  So I'm deleting it for now.

// For example, a web spidering script/library could store information about the web structure and even page contents so that other scripts can use that information without spidering the target again, but ensuring that the memory will be freed after the hostgroup finishes so there is room to store the web information for the next group of systems.  One idea would be to make a host.registry member which contains a registry specific to a specific target.  Scripts could store temporary information there, but still use the global registry for information which must persist (e.g. to be used by postrules, etc.)

    to 100000 microseconds, much higher than the straightforward
    calculation would give. What I think is really happening is that
    select is not working reliably on this platform (Solaris 10 x86).
    In the loop in read_arp_reply_pcap, pcap_select returns 1, then a
    pcap_next is done. Then pcap_select returns 0, but if I insert
    another pcap_next after that, the pcap_next finds another packet

  [Josh implemented poll as a SoC student, but it had problems with
  Nsock's architecture.  O(1) lookups were becoming O(n) because of
  the nature of the data structures. It was slower in his benchmarks.
  Nsock would have change from a model of "loop over the event list,
  and check to see if the fd for each event is set," to one of "loop
  over the fd list, and see if there is a corresponding event for
  each. It is the "see if the fd is set" operation that's O(1) with
  select (it's FD_ISSET) and O(n) with poll (it's a traversal of a
  linked list).]

               !-utf 86 -- There is no way to manipulate the timeouts in WInPcap like we do on other platforms... 
               /!\ Specify a timeout when you do pcap_open 
               note: Like to set a timeout on every read. So, sort of sneak in and call PacketSetReadTimeout... 
               note: In the code there is a comment: '# バグ。これは不正行為です！' 
               /!\ libdnet also uses the Packet* functions, but in a more innocuous way. 
               /!\ It does not access them through a struct pcap. So, it does not need pcap-int.h...
               Also, try testing whether this makes any signficiant difference--to see if we could just remove the PcapSetReadTimeout()--but that did not work out. - We are not going to worry about this for now since it is not important enough to pester the pcap people about, and they do not seem to be changing their internal structure anyway.  And if they do, we can get the new pcap-int.h..."

Remove --interactive.  It was broken for a long time and nobody
  seemed to notice, and we put a call out on nmap-dev for
  --interactive users and didn't get any good reasons to keep it.  We
  should kill it to remove the code complexity it adds and to avoid
  the documentation complexity of people having to read and learn
  about a feature they are unlikely to ever use.
~
o Zenmanp should perhaps be able to print Nmap output on a Printer (if
  not too much of a pain to implement.)
~
o Review afp-serverinfo.nse from Andrew Orr.
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/470 Just waiting on some bug fixes:
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/665
~
o Test 64-bit pcap installer (e.g. remove old version and install new)
  before next release, as we've applied a change from Rob which works on
  his system (http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/796).
~
o [NSE] Improve username/password library (the database files
  themselves).  We don't have very good lists at the moment.  Maybe
  work in combination with Ncrack dev.
  o Now there are some even better lists available (f.e. RockYou)--see
    this thread: http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/764
  o We've improved the ncrack files--we should probably either use
    those for NSE or use a subset of them.
  o perhaps from Solar Designer. (he sent us permission)
  o perhaps add phpbb hack data (there is at least a list of 28,635
    passwords in phpbb_users.sql, and possibly more in other files.
~
o [Nping] Should take the version number 0.[nmap version], such as
  0.5.22TEST
~
o Review rpc.lua, nfs-showmount.nse, nfs-get-stats.nse, and
  nfs-get-dirlist.nse from Patrik Karlsson.
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/270
~
o [NSE] Look into moving packet module to C for better performance
  [Patrick]
  o Removing this one because it is stale (has been here for many
    months with no action seen), but it is something we can consider
    if/when there is a desire to implement it.  A key is probably to
    measure current performance and see if it is a material problem.
~
o Maybe the Nmap ASCII art should come after make rather than
  configure?
  - We decided it would probably be annoying for developers to see it
    every time they 'make'.
~
o Review snmpenum.nse from William Njuguna.
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/721
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/656
  o Dropping for now unless original author or someone else picks it
  up and fixes the bugs.
~
o Add smtp-enum-users from Duarte Silva if testing is favorable.
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/699
~
o After the new -sn and -Pn options (added to SVN around 7/20, just
  after the 5.00 release) have been around long enough to be in most
  people's copy of Nmap (e.g. in all the versions we distribute from
  download page (stable+dev)) for at least a few months, we'll document
  these as the preferred version rather than -sP and -PN.  These match
  -n, and the main problem with -sP is that we now use it more for
  "disable portscan" than ping only.  For example, you can also use
  NSE, traceroute, etc. [David]
~
o Nmap currently selects routes based on the first matching one it
  finds.  But it should really take the most specific route instead.
  So it should:
  1) Keep searching the routing table for the most specific match, and
  2) Use a stable sort (not qsort) so that routes with identical
     netmasks aren't rearranged.
  For more, see http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/685
~
o Review pgsql-brute.nse from Patrik Karlsson.
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/455
~
o psexec missing (need to download yourself now) nmap_services.exe
  output issue: "The function where this is detected returns a value
  that is passed to stdnse.format_output. format_output takes a
  parameter to decide whether it's displaying an error message, but it
  is hard-coded to only display error messages with debugging >= 1. So
  options are to change format_output and make it more flexible, or
  somehow decouple the sensing of nmap_service.exe from the normal
  output channel of the script."
~
o Website: Create shared directory in svn, which will contain
  directories shared between the Insecure.org network of sites
  (e.g. templates, error, css).  Then sites such as sectools,
  nmap.org, insecure.org can just check that out via externals
  declaration (or, I suppose, symlink).  CSS directives will then use
  /shared/css/insecdb.css etc. ).
~
o Add CouchDB and JSON scripts once the JSON library is finished.
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/641
~
o Review NSE raw IP from Kris Katterjohn.
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/559
~
o Review sslv3-enum.nse from Mak Kolybabi.
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/563
~
o [NSE] Consider LDAP library and scripts from Patrik Karlsson.
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/70 [all merged, except David is
  still reviewing ldap-search]
~
o More potential improvements to http-methods:
   http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/630 and
   http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/640
~
o Remove smtp-open-relay.nse sometime after 9/24/09 if nobody adopts it (see
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/0986.html). [It got fixed up
  and we kept it.]
~
o The -v and -d arguments should take the same syntax.  Right now you
  use -vvv vs. -d3. We should probably just make either approach work
  with either of them.
~
o Zenmap should be able to export normal Nmap output
~
o Integrate Nping.
~
o [NSE] Consider the http-methods script from Bernd Stroessenreuther.
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/76. [integrated, but David is
  making some improvements].
~
o The Nmap web page is beginning to show its age.  Ah, who am I
  kidding, it was showing its age 5 years ago :).  It could do with an
  upgrade to XHTML+CSS.  It could also do with a whole redesign, but I
  think that can be done as a second step after converting to
  XHTML+CSS with roughly the same look.  Though adding a few more
  modern touches (like hover interaction on the menu bar) wouldn't
  hurt.  This is a moderatly big project, which will involve: o
  Designing the new XHTML+CSS to look similar to the current HTML
  pages, but be extensible enough that it can be redesigned in the
  (near) future by mostly just changing the CSS and graphics.  
    o Converting the existing Nmap pages to the new XHTML format.
      This will likely include using open source programs and likely
      modifying them or creating your own scripts to help with the
      process.  To apply for this task, you need to have some web
      development experience and an example XHTML+CSS web page you
      have created online.
    o We decided not to worry about XHTML for now, and we're
      integrating CSS in piece by piece -- we already have the section
      headers, left sidebar links. etc.
    o Should not use SSI like the current pages -- should do all its
      magic through CSS. That way it will work on seclists too (which
      can't do SSI for security reasons).
    o Maybe alpha transparency for menus, gradiants, curves, etc.  But
      the main goal isn't flashiness.
~
o Seclists.org should maybe be fixed so that it doesn't strip quoted
  text for its summaries from the IP list because that list consists
  almost entirely of forwarded material which is being stripped.  Look
  at the summaries at http://seclists.org/interesting-people/.
~
o Web site HTML improvements
  - Maybe start with nmap.org.
    - Find and fix HTML validation problems, bad links.  I'm not sure
      what tool is best for this.
  - Then do the same with seclists.org, insecure.org, sectools.org
  - The icon on the top-left of the screen should be for (and link
    to) the root URL of current site.  e.g. seclists.org,
    sectools.org, nmap.org rather than always insecure.org.
~
o [NSE] Consider SNMP scripts from Patrik Karlsson.
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/162
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/174
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/178
~
o Deal with AV false positive issue RE nmap_services.exe:
 - For now, David is going to apply Ron's patch which removes this,
   but David will make it print output in verbose mode rather than
   debug and maybe make it a little less verbose. LT plan is for Ron
   to encrypt it with OpenSSL.
~
o Web site improvements
    - Update to use CSS, at least for header bars
      - Also, if it is easy to give the header bars rounded corners,
        we should probably do so.  But if it is hard, it isn't
        important enough to matter.
    - The Nmap.Org navigation table should have a background and more
      subtle lines, like we use for our calendars now.
    - The first item (table) in featured news has slightly more
      left/right margin than the later ones on Firefox 3.5.6, and with
      IE8 it doesn't extend as far when you make the page really wide.
      Plus the images on the right are problematic (extend through the
      border below them) when you make the window too wide on IE8.
      Having a slight margin on the left/right of entries would
      actually be a bit nice.  And it would be nice if it only took a
      simple tag or two, controlled by CSS rather than pasting in a
      whole table with font tags and the like for each entry.
~

  proxy authentication patch.  See

  https://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/nmap.html#condvar) [Patrick]
~
o Make Nmap 5.21 bugfix-only release
~
o [NSE] Consider afp-showmount script from Patrik Karlsson.
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/97
  [merged to trunk]
~
o [NSE] Review DNS-SD script from Patrik Karlsson.
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/87
  [merged to trunk]
~
o [NSE] Consider MySQL scripts from Patrik Karlsson.
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/163
  [merged to trunk]
~
o [NSE] Consider DAAP script from Patrik Karlsson.
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/164
  [merged to trunk]
~
o NSEDoc left sidebar should include a link to
  https://nmap.org/book/nse.html below "Index".
~
o Consider enhancing the new OS Assist system to handle version
  detection too. [We decided not to do this as David noted that Doug's
  serviceunwrap.lisp does pretty much everything he needs.]
~
o [NSE] HTTP header parsing is not very robust, and is duplicated in a
  lot of places. For example, it's legal to have header fields like
Content-type:\r\n
___text/html\r\n
(with spaces in place of _, but http.lua won't parse such a header
correctly. In other words you can extend them to any number of lines
as long as each line after the first begins with whitespace. [David]
~
o Investigate issue with our Pcap and Wireshark x64, as described in
  this thread: http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/557 [Rob]
  [Taking this off the list until/unless we get more reports]
~
o Decide what to do about Windows 7/Vista and starting NPF.  See this
  thread: http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/20
~
o [NSE] We should do a favicon survey like the one Brandon did for
  /favicon.ico files but which uses the favicons specified by the HTML
  files rather than just that exact location.  For example, insecure.org
  sites include in the headers:
  <link REL="SHORTCUT ICON" HREF="http://images.insecure.org/images/tiny-eyeicon.png" TYPE="image/png">
  Then we should update our favicon database to include the top ones,
  and we should also improve our favicon script so that it either
  omits checking /favicon.ico if the HTML-specified one exists, or it
  should just download, interpret, and display info for both (right
  now it seems to give prority to the wrong one: /favicon.ico).
~
break;
o [Ncat] Add SSL support for --exec so you can use SSL to talk to your
  remote shell, etc.  See this thread:
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/255, particularly the
  implementation sketch at http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/268 [Venkat,David]
~
o Look at new Kerberos script from Patrik Karlsson.
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/715 .  [We decided not to merge
  this one since its usefulness turned out to be limited on Windows and
  very limited on any other platform. ]
~
o Add feature to http library to let user set the user agent to be
  used. The NSEDoc for this feature should probably tell what our
  current default user agent is ("Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Nmap
  Scripting Engine; https://nmap.org/book/nse.html") [David]
~
o On our NSEDoc pages (e.g. https://nmap.org/nsedoc/), perhaps the link
  text for scripts should not include the ".nse".  Basides saving
  horizontal space, this may improve the sorting so that the likes of
  "citrix-enum-apps" comes before "citrix-enum-apps-xml".  Also, we can
  probably get away with reducing the width of the NSEDoc left-column,
  especially if ".nse" is removed.
~
o [NSE] Patrick's script dependency patch:
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/295
  o I'm not sure if he has gone through and actually set appropriate
    dependencies (and removed runlevels) yet
~
o Integrate latest version detection submissions and corrections.
  This was last done based on submissions until February 9, 2009.
~
o Release 5.10BETA2
~
o Add --evil to set the RFC3514 evil bit.
  ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc3514.txt
  o We're not going to add this right now.
~
o Talk to Libpcap folks about incorporating (at least some of) my
  changes from libpcap/NMAP_MODIFICATIONS. [marking as done since the
  upstream-appropriate changes are pretty minor now that we've
  upgraded to 1.0]
~
o Nping -- like hping3 but uses Nmap infrastructure and to a
  large degree the same command-line options as Nmap.
  [We now have an alpha version at https://nmap.org/nping/]
~
o Further investigate SCTP functionality, as some people reported
  problems (see this thread:
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0669.html)
~
o [NSE] NFS query script for checking exports, etc.? [Patrik Karlsson]
~
o [NSE] Attempt to reproduce and fix a deadlock reported by Brandon
  when he does large-scale scanning with a new favicon script with
  hostgroups as small as 8,192 (he hasn't seen it with 4096
  hostgroups). Could be a bug in internal NSE socket lock. Probably
  not specific to the favicon script, but that is how Brandon
  reproduces it. At the hang, stack trace is usually the threads stuck
  in socket_lock function, sometimes lookup_cache mutex in http
  library. David guesses that it's threads being garbage-collected
  from the socket lock table. The only thing that can wake up a thread
  waiting on a socket lock is if a thread that holds a lock is removed
  from the table. But the table has weak keys, meaning that a thread
  can be garbage collected and it will be automatically removed from
  the table by the Lua runtime. Then there is no event that can wake
  up a thread waiting for a lock. [David and Patrick made some commits
  at end of November meant to resolve this, and we haven't seen the
  problem since, so we're marking it as done for now].
~
o Look into reducing Nmap memory consumption
  o UDP scans with -p- and large hostgroups are a particularly large
    offender.  See if there is a way to prevent them from eating up
    gigs of RAM. See the message "Port memory bloat" at
    http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/0926.html for a patch that
    reduces Port memory use by about 50%. 
  o One idea David has been considering is a way to represent filtered
    ports (or whatever the default state is) without creating a Port
    object for each one.
  [David]
~
o Fix assertion failure with certain --exclude arguments (see
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/276). [David]
~
o Many people may have stale (since removed/renamed) scripts in their
  Nmap scripts directory because our 'make install' does not remove
  them and so they remain and can cause problems (like running twice
  after being renamed).  We should probably add a line to our 'make
  install' which removes the scripts/lib names we have previously
  used.  We're doing this rather than blowing away the old directory
  just in case someone has custom scripts/libs there (though that is
  still a bad idea). [David]
~
o Update the CHANGELOG for new 5.10BETA1
  release. [Fyodor]
~
o Make the new Nmap 5.10BETA1 release
~
o Ndiff man page should be built from XML source whenever a release is
  done, as ncat/zenmap/nmap man pages are. [Fyodor]
~
o We should package the rendered Nroff man page translations (e.g. all
  16 languages) in the tarball to make it easier for distributors to
  package them.  For example, see
  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=358336.  Including
  the translations would add 2.5MB to the (currently 28MB)
  uncompressed tarball and about 800KB to the (currently 9MB) bz2
  compressed tarball. [Fyodor]
~
o The Nmap 5.00 tarball contains:
  -rw-r--r-- fyodor/fyodor 122943 2009-06-24 14:35 nmap-5.00/docs/scripting.xml
  -rw-r--r-- fyodor/fyodor    151 2009-06-24 14:35 nmap-5.00/docs/nmap-usage.xml
  -rw-r--r-- fyodor/fyodor    604 2009-06-24 14:35 nmap-5.00/docs/nmap-man-enclosure.xml
  -rw-r--r-- fyodor/fyodor  76918 2009-06-24 14:35 nmap-5.00/docs/nmap-install.xml
  -rw-r--r-- fyodor/fyodor  10179 2009-06-24 14:35 nmap-5.00/docs/legal-notices.xml
  If we're going to include the XML source files, we should include
  refguide too.  But rather than add that, we should probably take
  these out.  After all, people can easily grab them from svn or our
  new http svn gateway if desired.  So no need to bloat the tarball
  with these files which aren't installed. [We're going to take the
  XML source files out of the tarball] [Fyodor]
~
o Consider converting this file to emacs org-mode
  (http://orgmode.org/) format. [Fyodor]
  o That format is still plain text and can be read/edited by vi
    users, etc.
  [Considered, but I don't think I'll change right now]
~
o Windows 7 RTM Nmap testing (With particular attention to 64-bit and
  our pcap installer). [Fyodor]
~
o We should print host latency (when available) in the XML output, as
  suggested at http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/215.
  docs/nmap.dtd will have to be modified accordingly, and you might
  even consider adding support to docs/nmap.xsl.
~
o Integrate latest OS fingerprint submissions and corrections. This
  was last done based on submissions up to May 8, 2009.
~
o Potential OS X 10.6 problems.  There are two issues reported by the
  same user which may be related:
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/0936.html,
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/0996.html.  One is that Nmap
  hangs doing nothing and needs to be killed with Ctrl-C, and the
  other is that it dies after printing "Initiating UDP Scan".  Another
  reported the same problem at
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/0990.html, where it dies after
  the first ARP request is sent.  But Brandon has run Nmap on 10.6
  without problems.  It is a bit of a mystery. [David] [Resolution:
  Apple fixed the problems in 10.6.2; For users who have 10.6 and
  10.6.1, the versions David builds on 10.5 will still work for them
  because they are 32-bit binaries rather than 64.  Users who build
  Nmap on 10.6 or 10.6.1 should compile with -m32 or update to 10.6.2]
~
o [NSE] Patrick's worker thread patch:
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/294
~
o Investigate get_rpc_results error (infinite loop) reported by Lionel
  Cons. See these threads: http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/24,
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/120
~
o Upgrade to latest version of NSIS on Nmap Win build system [Fyodor].
~
o Standardize on a proper file header for the Zenmap source code. [David]
 o For now, David is going to augment the templatereplacement system
   to insert the normal nmap.header.tmpl, but change the comment format
   to work with Python, and then replace the current Zenmap headers
   with that.
~
o We may want to look into if/how we support IPv6 nameservers.  Here
  is a bug report from someone having a problem with them:
  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=539244 [Ankur]
~
o Once all the man page languages are in the Nmap tarball, we should
  update our install system to install them in the appropriate place.
  We'll want to integrate this with configure so users can decide which
  languages they want.  See http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/249.
~
o Resolve allow_ipid_match issue which can cause some malformed
  replies to be ignored when we might be able to still use them.  See
  this thread: http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/665 [David]
~
o Fix Zenmap 'make install' TypeError issue
  (http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/225). [David]
~
o Fix a bug in which Nmap can wrongly associate responses to SYN and
  ACK host discovery probes.  [David]
  For example:
  # nmap -sP -PS80 -PA80 australia.gov.au --packet-trace -d2
  SENT (0.0760s) TCP 192.168.0.21:60182 > 152.91.126.70:80 S ttl=43 id=13466 iplen=44  seq=4046449223 win=4096 <mss 1460>
  SENT (0.0770s) TCP 192.168.0.21:60182 > 152.91.126.70:80 A ttl=48 id=39976 iplen=40  seq=4046449223 win=1024 ack=921915001
  RCVD (0.3020s) TCP 152.91.126.70:80 > 192.168.0.21:60182 SA ttl=53 id=0 iplen=44  seq=3924706636 win=5840 ack=4046449224 <mss 1380>
  We got a TCP ping packet back from 152.91.126.70 port 80 (trynum = 0)
  ultrascan_host_probe_update called for machine 152.91.126.70 state UNKNOWN -> HOST_UP (trynum 0 time: 226875) Changing ping technique for 152.91.126.70 to tcp to port 80; flags: A
 In the example above, Nmap wrongly uses ACK as the preferred ping technique, when it should be SYN. [David]
 o we're thinking about ways to encode the information better.  Right
  now we have pingseq and tryno, but we may want to just move to a
  single probe ID and then we can look up any other information in
  structures attached to that ID in memory when we get the response.
 o A related problem, which we hope the fix for this will also
  resolve, is that replies can currently match any probe whose tryno
  is less than or equal to the tryno encoded in the reply.
   o However, "fixing" this problem has been shown in the past to
     cause accuracy problems.  See
     http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/387.  We should figure out
     whether we can still reproduce that and, if so, what is going on
     before "fixing" this issue.
~
o Add PJL (Printer Job Language) probes to
  nmap-service-probes. Brandon wrote some in
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0560.html. Test them to see if
  they cause anything to be printed out (on paper) with printers that
  don't support PJL. If not, then remove the JetDirect ports from the
  default exclude list. The script pjl-ready-message.nse also uses
  PJL.  We have concerns about the safety of this probe given
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/61, but it still is probably
  better to have the probe in there than not, as long as we continue
  blocking the ports by default with the Exclude directive.
  [We put in the probes, but are keeping the Exclude directives
  because the probes still seem a bit dangerous]
~
o [NSE] in_chksum in packet.lua doesn't work with an odd number of
  bytes.  Also make it more efficient.
~
o Add --confdir option to Zenmap. See
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/92 [David]
~
o Update our Winpcap from 4.0.2 to 4.1.1
  (http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/128).  This is a bit complex
  because we have our own installer.  See
  https://nmap.org/svn/mswin32/winpcap/Upgrading-Instructions.txt.
~
o Change Nmap to not show the "Host not scanned" lines in list scan
~
o Change Nmap to show latency in "host is up" lines even w/o verbose
  mode.
~
o Update our included Libpcap from 0.9.7 to 1.0.0
  (http://www.tcpdump.org/) [David]
~
o Improve Nmap output to show the forward DNS name when specified on
  command line as well as rDNS where appropriate.  We're also going to
  reorganize output to enable some other improvements as well.  See
  the proposal at http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/814, and that
  whole thread which starts at
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/805 [David].
~
o [Zenmap] Solve some unusual utf8 Zenmap crashes reported in the
  crash reporter. David has fixed some of them so far, but there are a
  few more remaining that may be related. [David]
~
o Change Nsock to give an error if you try to FD_SET a fd larger than
  FD_SETSIZE. [Brandon]
  o Some research from David:
     We have help off on this change because of Windows portability
     problems. The Windows fd_set works differently than the Unix
     fd_set. In Unix, FD_SETSIZE (which is typically 1024) is both the
     maximum number of file descriptors that can be in the set and one
     greater than the greatest file descriptor number that can be
     set. In other words, we want to bail out whenever someone tries
     to FD_SET file descriptor 1060, for example. But on Windows it's
     different: FD_SETSIZE is only 64, but any file descriptor
     numbers, no matter how great, may be stored in the set. Windows
     socket descriptors are typically greater than 1023, but you can
     only have 64 of them in the set at once.
~
     So the fix on Unix would be

~
     But that doesn't work on Windows (I just tried it) because even
     the smallest socket descriptor is bigger than FD_SETSIZE, 64.
     Really we're trying to accomplish two different things on the two
     platforms: On Unix we must not store a file descriptor greater
     than 1023, no matter how many or how few other descriptors have
     been set. On Windows we must not set more than 64 descriptors at
     a time, no matter what their descriptor number happens to be.
~
o Add a way in NSE to set socket source addresses and port numbers.
  See this thread: http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/821.  Some
  potential solutions are discussed later in the thread.
~
o [Ncat] Fix --max-conns on Windows so that it only counts concurrent
  connections and not long-dead ones.  See this thread
  (http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/1017.html) and particularly this
  message (http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/1032.html) for
  details.  Venkat has a patch for David to review and potentially merge.
~
o [Ncat] Fix 100% CPU usage with ncat -l --send-only.  See this
  thread: http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/797 and continues
  further at http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/99.  This message is
  key: http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/308 [David]
~
o [Seclists] There is currently some extra vertical space after the
  first post of a thread in the thread index (example:
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/index.html).
~
o [NSE] Decide which scripts belong to the "safe" category (we now have 20
  which aren't either safe or intrusive), then remove the intrusive
  category since people can now specify "not safe".  See
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/1091.html and that whole
  thread. [Fyodor]
  [ OK, see http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/0002.html]
~
o [NSE] Fix http pipelining.  Responses are being split on anything
  that looks like HTTP/1.X which doesn't come at the beginning of a
  line, and doesn't work when a line like that happens to legitimately
  come in a body.  Joao has an nmap-exp branch which resolves this
  issue, though David found some bugs in that and sent some hard test
  cases. [Joao]
~
o Fix traceroute performance/algorithms.  It is terribly bad in some
  cases.  For example, this traceroute scan took 36 minutes against a
  single host(!): http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/0425.html .  We
  don't need to go up to hop 50 in such cases (maybe some heuristic
  like "at least go to hop 15, and stop after 5 unresolved in a row).
  And more importantly, there is no reason each hop should take 40s to
  timeout.  It should probably use timeout variables like we use in
  port scanning.  And it should parallelize as much as possible.  Even
  if parallel resolution means we went a little further than we had to
  in incrementing the TTL, and we go to hop 15 when host is at 12
  that's no big deal (of course we would only report up to hop 12 in
  the output).  Once we do this, we should put back the ability to
  make --traceroute work even when we haven't found a probe which
  elicits a response from the target. (that feature was added in July,
  but we'll probably take it out until we can fix
  performance). [David]
~
o Fix four Nmap bugs discovered by Ankur and analyzed a bit by
  David. [Ankur]
~
o [NSE] Consider HTTP request caching.
~
o [NSE] Finish (or write new) favicon fingerprinting script. See
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q4/0583.html .  May need to do
  some more scanning and increase the DB size a bit.  May or may not
  want to later combine this as part of a larger webapp fingerprinting
  script.
~
o [Zenmap] When the inventory is changed, the current host/service selection is
  forgotten and the Ports / Hosts tab is switched to hosts mode. It should
  remember your current selection and not change the view. [David/SoC]
~
o Device categorization improvements
  o Examine Nmap's device categorization in nmap-os-deb and
    nmap-service-probes.  Decide if some small categories which have
    never really took off should be consolidated, or whether others
    should be split off.  For example, maybe there are some groups in
    'specialized' or other misc. categories which are now large enough
    to split off.  Personally, I wouldn't give anything its own
    category unless there are at least half a dozen of them and no
    other category really fits them well.  We should use a combined
    system for nmap-os-db and nmap-service-probes.
  o Add a classification sect1 to os-detection.xml
    (https://nmap.org/book/osdetect.html) to cover how Nmap handles OS
    classification.  It should include a list with descriptions of
    each device type recognized by Nmap.  Version-detection.xml should
    reference (link to) it in the approprate place.
    [Doug has done some initial work on this.  For example, see
     nmap/docs/device-types.txt] [David]
~
o Consider what new UDP payloads we might want to add.  David has many
  ideas at: http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/0290.html
~
o For traceroute we should give some indication that the RTT is in ms.
  Changing the column header to maybe "RTT MS" or "RTT (MS)" would
  probably do the trick or we could append "ms" to each value.
  [David]
~
o OS fingerprint should probably specify somewhow when DS=1 if it's
  because target->directlyConnected is true, or because it sent the
  distance probe and calculated a distance of 1.  The second situation
  should never happen, but often David strongly suspects that it is the
  case.
~
o --traceroute should probably set currenths->distance because right
  now, I do an -O scan against scanme.nmap.org, and it does not figure
  out the distance.  So the fingerprint shows no distance element and
  Nmap doesn't print "Network Distance" in the results line.  That may
  be OK (Nmap probably isn't receiving the probe response needed for
  this, and maybe doesn't want to print the TG), but even when I do
  --traceroute I get no distance printed.  Yet Nmap clearly knows the
  distance since the traceroute shows all the hops up to and including
  the target (scanme.nmap.org).
~
o Figure out best favicon to use for Nmap and related web sites
  [David]
~
o [Ncat] David says: "After you get EOF on stdin with --send-only, the
  program hangs on until the idle timeout expires instead of terminating
  immediately.  I had a fix for it but it involved deleting events in
  the Nsock queue and it caused an assertion failure in Nmap so I backed
  it out. I have a less intrusive solution." [David]
~
o We should update our config.{sub,guess} files.  This Debian bug
  #542079 requests that we do so:
  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=542079.  We last
  updated on 3/15/08 and in that case we used versions from
  http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/config/?root=config.  That may or
  may not be the best place to get them now (e.g. perhaps there has
  been a recent official release). [David]
~
o Look a bit more at default version detection timing.  Particularly
  deciding the number of probes to run in parallel. [ We increased
  that a bit on 8/18/09]
~
o [Ncat] Right now our -i (idle timeout) causes Ncat to quit if EITHER
  reading or writing is idle for the given amount of time.  But it is
  really only idle if BOTH reading AND writing are idle for the
  period.  We should make the code work that way.
~
o Add scripting.xml documentation on strict.lua and the avoidance of
  global vars in libraries. See
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/0169.html. Probably a new
  section just above "Adding C Modules to "Nselib", such as "Writing
  Your Own Library" or somesuch. [Patrick]
~
o Update nsedoc to refer to 'libraries' rather than 'modules'.  This
  affects the front page (which calls them 'Libraries' on left sidebar
  and 'Modules' on the list of right, and affects the url (we should
  change /modules/ to /lib/ and then have Fyodor add a redirect for
  people still using old URLs) and the title of the module pages like
  https://nmap.org/nsedoc/modules/base64.html. [Patrick]
~
o [Ncat] Prefix Ncat stderr messages with "Ncat: " to make it clear
  that they are coming from Ncat and not the remote server (or typed in
  by user). [David/SoC]
~
o [NSE] Optimize NSE Performance--e.g. measure the current performance and
  see what can be improved in terms of scheduling scan threads,
  determining how many to run concurrently, looking at CPU load items,
  etc. [David/Patrick]
~
o Increase version scan concurrency based on Patrick's performance
  testing.  We decided to go to 20 for timing_level 3, 30 for 4, and 50
  for 5.
~
o [NSE] Consider POST/HEAD support. See
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0889.html.
  o Implemented:  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/0074.html
  o Joao going to check in very soon soon.
~
o [NSE] Consider Rob Nicholls http-enum script for incorporation:
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0889.html
  [Joao tested w/his HEAD support, is going to check this in]
~
o Consider the open proxy scripts more carefully
 - How should we test whether the proxy attempt was successful?  Right
   now we look for a google-specific Server header after trying to
   reach http://www.google.com through the proxy.  Maybe we should let
   users specify their own pattern if they specify their own URL.
  [ Joao is going to check it in today (7/28)]
~
o I should add code to Nmap to bail if sizeof(char) isn't 1.
  Otherwise there could be security risks if it is not one on any
  platforms.  [ Actually, we think C standard requires this and we've
  not heard of any system where sizeof(char) isn't 1.  So removing
  this item.]
~
o [Zenmap] More complete implementation of ZenmapCommandLine/profile
  editor improvement ideas. See
  http://www.bamsoftware.com/wiki/Nmap/ZenmapCommandLine. [David]
~
o [Ncat] Think about whether we should offer "-q secs" (quit after EOF
  + delay of secs) and/or -k (set SO_KEEPALIVE on socket) (or maybe
  that should be set by default).  Anyway, these were suggested here:
  http://lwn.net/Articles/341706/ [We're going to fix -i (added
  separate item), and not worry about SO_KEEPALIVE unless we see more
  demand for it. It doesn't seem that nc110 or OpenBSD nc or so-called
  GNU Netcat support SO_KEEPALIVE either]
~
o [Ncat] In verbose mode, I'd like to see clock time (duration) and
  maybe in/out traffic stats when a client connection ends.  Maybe it
  could use a format similar to what Nmap provides. [David/Venkat]
~
o Seriously consider making --traceroute work even when we haven't
  found a probe which elicits a response from the target.  We'd just
  have to pick a probe in that case (probably echo request, as we
  found that to be the most effective in prev. empirical testing).
  This is similar to UNIX traceroute and Windows tracert.exe which
  just pick a probe (high UDP port on UNIX, ICMP echo request on Win).
  Even if the host is down or something, we usually get some useful
  hop information.
~
o [NSE] Allow spaces in script arguments without the user having to
  manually quote them (beyond normal shell escape quoting).  See:
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/0090.html
  [Patrick]
~
o [Ncat] Support SCTP now that Nmap does. 
  - See client support patch by Daniel Roethlisberger: 
    http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0609.html
  - Server support?
  - Daniel has a patch, David looking to apply once an nsock thing is fixed.
~
o Look at etc/payloads.conf in unicornscan-0.4.7 and see if they have
  any which we don't have, but should, for our version detection.
  They have a decent collection there.  KX sent some other programs we
  should look at too. [David]
~
o Ncat should give it's ethernet cat ASCII logo after
  configure--similar to the way that Nmap, Ncrack, and Nping
  do. [David/SoC]
~
o [Zenmap] The Search dialogue is helpful for finding a certain scan
  you've performed recently, but we should probably also offer a similar
  function for searching for certain applications/hosts within a scan
  (e.g. find all the hosts running Apache).  This new functionality
  might be a find option or some other mechanism rather than being
  part of the Search dialogue proper.
~
o Ncat SSLv2 issues.  See
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0319.html.  A big part of it is
  done, which was enhanced version detection probes to detect more SSL
  servers, The defect that remains is that Nsock can't connect to a
  small fraction of servers (including some of the ones detected by
  the new version probe). They are the servers that do only SSLv3 or
  TLSv1 and don't respond to a SSLv2-compatible ClientHello.  Even
  though most servers don't support SSLv2, they usually respond to the
  ClientHello and just don't offer any SSLv2 features. [David/Venkat
  working on this]
~
o Deadlock identification and correction:
 o Plan of action: implement freeing of script mutexes when scripts
 exit without freeing them (done and in /nmap now). And then if it
 continues to be a problem we'll consider this other stuff:
  o Add detection for deadlocks and print which threads are involved.
  o use above results to make a strategy for automatic deadlock resolution.
  o Original entry: Figure out what to do about NSE mutexes:
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0276.html . In particular, they
  are not currently cleaned up if a thread dies or otherwise exits
  without unlocking them and can cause endless deadlocks which are
  annoying to users and can be difficult to debug :(.  Patrick has
  some ideas for this in his SoC09 proposal:
   "Adding a cleanup system for NSE that is called periodically
    similar to nsock_loop. There would be a registration system
    allowing C libraries to register a Lua function that will run
    periodically to check for irresolvable deadlock or simply dead
    resources. For example, the nmap library would register a mutex
    cleanup handler which would inspect all mutexes looking for a dead
    thread or circular dependencies. The nsock library could register
    a handler that checks for unused sockets. The nsock may save a
    strong reference to the thread that owns the socket and inspect it
    to determine if the thread is dead."
  David later says: "After some discussion we decided to start more
  modestly, first by ensuring that a scripts mutexes are released when
  it dies for whatever reason. I have a hunch that this is the cause
  of most deadlocks. It was certainly the cause of two whois.nse
  deadlocks I found. Then, the next step if deadlocks continue to be a
  problem, is to do automatic detection and just print out a list of
  what scripts are involved. It could be that several smb scripts are
  deadlocked, or as in the case I observed where whois.nse was locked
  with itself."
~
o Joao is auditing his Lua code to make sure all his variables are
  local where appropriate. [Joao - done, should be commited very soon]
~
o [NSE] We need to deal with libraries which improperly use global
  variables, as that is very common (Patrick made a list:
  http://batbytes.com/bad.txt).  Solutions could involve augmenting
  our runtime system (the "strict.lua" approach) to detect/prevent the
  problem, a script we run occasionally to identify issues that we
  then manually resolve, or, at the very minimum, documenting
  somewhere in scripting.xml the dangers inherent in global variables
  and warn people to generally declare them local instead.  We have a
  long history of bugs caused by non-local variables defined in NSE
  libraies and often causing deadlocks.
~
o The Nmap refguide (https://nmap.org/book/man-performance.html) says
  "The --max-parallelism option is sometimes set to one to prevent Nmap
  from sending more than one probe at a time to hosts. This can be
  useful in combination with --scan-delay (discussed later), although
  the latter usually serves the purpose well enough by itself."  But
  when you actually try it:
  # ./nmap --max-parallelism 1 --scan-delay 10 scanme.nmap.org
  You can't use --max-parallelism with --scan-delay.
  QUITTING!
  We need to either make that work or adjust the documentation. [David/SoC]
  o David changed this to a warning.  Note that with --scan-dealy,
  --max-parallelism is essentially 1 anyway.
~
o [NSE] Consider integrating HP Laserjet print PJL status-setting
  script.  See this thread for an example of such a script:
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/0083.html (note that it is
  updated during the thread).  Also, see this thread:
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/0092.html
~
o Ndiff man page should be expanded to include sample execution/output
  and more fully describe its functionality. [David]
~
o David is going to reexamine the old coverity-reported issues (the
  ones we previously marked as "ignore" because they weren't real bugs)
  just to be sure that is (and is still) the case.
~
o Make -sP work with -PN to disable both port and ping scanning.  We
  need to make sure the various options still work (-O, --script,
  --traceroute, etc.) with this, as many currently don't as they don't
  expect this behavior, which used to be unsupported and cause Nmap to
  quit with an error messaqge.  It may be OK to refuse -O since that
  will rarely give useful results.  OTOH, -O may work on some systems
  with unique closed port signatures where Nmap guesses a closed
  port. Users should then be able to do an NSE-only scan with "-sP -PN
  --script [scripts]" We should document this -sP -PN usage in
  refguide.  [David]
~
o Add -sn and -Pn options which are aliases for -sP and -PN.  Once
  they've been around long enough to be in most people's copy of Nmap,
  we plan to document those as the preferred version.  Those match -n,
  and the main problem with -sP is that we now use it more for
  "disable portscan" than ping only.  For example, you still might
  want to use NSE. [David]
~
o [NSE] Make sure all our HTTP scripts transparently support SSL
  servers too. [Joao has a solution and is testing the http scripts to
  make sure they don't break.]
~
o Resolve "memcpy overlap in getinterfaces(int*) (tcpip.cc:2987)".
  See this thread: http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0713.html
  [David/Brandon]
~
o [Ncat] Print a message to stderr upon connection failure even if -v
  isn't specified so the user knows what went wrong. [David/SoC]
~
o [Ncat] Maybe --chat should imply -l.  And Maybe --broker should too?
  - OTOH, we might want to extend --chat for connect mode in the
    future.
  [We're going to hold off on chat now, David/SoC is doing --broker]
~
o Consider making it easier to tell whether scripts were specified by
  name on the command-line (rather than default or by class) so they
  have the option of providing extra verbosity in that case.  For
  example, see http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0563.html.  We
  could either provide a special function for scripts to determine
  that, or we could magically adjust nmap.verbosity() when called by
  those scripts. [David]
~
o [NSE] Figure out a way to support people who want to do script scan,
  but not port scan or ping scan.  One option would be to allow
  --script to list scan (-sL), but perhaps a better option is to
  provide a way to disable port scanning in the same way as we offer
  -PN to disable ping scanning.  As an example of this need, David had
  to write special code to avoid ping/port scanning when doing a
  whois.nse survey for
  http://www.bamsoftware.com/wiki/Nmap/EffectivenessOfPingProbes.  The
  key for this task is to figure out how to do it from a user
  interface perspective and then implement and document it.  We've
  already been going in the direction of allowing script scanning in
  more types of scans--a while back we started allowing it with -sP
  ping scans due to high demand. [David/SoC]
  [ We decided how we're going to do it (-sP -PN to start out with;
  leading to eventual -sn -Pn) and added new TODO entries for actually
  doing the code/docs. ]
~
o Ndiff should be able to show NSE script result changes. [David]
~
o Get set up for Coverity scan of latest version to see if it catches
  any important issues before stable release. [Fyodor,David]
  [Found 7 new results, 3 are real bugs, and 2 have been fixed so far]
~
o [nsock] Fix Makefile to handle dependencies correctly (if that turns
  out to be the problem).  See
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0629.html.  o Or it may be
  related to SVN timestampling.  See
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0632.html. Diagnosed by David:
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0728.html
~
o For at least our UDP ping probes, Nmap should probably notice if it
  is a very well known service port such as 53, 161, or 137 and send
  an appropriate probe packet (server status for DNS, public community
  string query for SNMP, etc) rather than empty data in that case.
  This is similar to the way our IP protocol probes automatically
  include common headers such as TCP and UDP if that common protocol
  is given.  Good probes for these services are already available in
  nmap-service-probes, though we might want to make a custom file for
  this.  We should probably do this for port scanning as well. [David]
~
o [NSE] Make NSE work better for SSL tunneled services in general by
  supporting them easily in the libraries.  For example, I don't think
  irc-info.nse currently works against all the servers which tunnel
  over SSL.  Maybe augment comm library, etc. [Joao - done, except for
  http, which is already a separate TODO item]
~
o Update scripts which use table args to use pseudo-table format
  "name.arg" rather than requiring the user to create a Lua table
  themselves. On the lua side, it's not really being stored in a
  table, but just an arg named "name.arg". [Joao]
  - Look at all our existing scripts which use tables
    (dns-zone-transfer, whois, the proxy scripts, etc.) and change as
    appropriate.  Remember to change the usage throughout the script
    and also change the nsedoc script arguments and example usage.
    For the existing scripts, try to retain the table version check
    for now to avoid breaing backward compatability if possible.  Just
    add the newer style check as well.
  - Is taking arguments in a table specific to a script a good idea?
    The example in the socks-open-proxy nsedoc of "--script-args
    openproxy={host=<host>}" is a bit of a mess and I'm not sure the
    best way to document that in the script argument list.  Note that
    this is the standard way we've handled it for some other scripts,
    so it's not an open-proxy-script-specific problem.
~
o [NSE] Track active sockets in the nsock library binding and don't
  rely on garbage collection for reallocation. Can probably wait until
  post-stable release for integration. [Patrick]
  - Patrick has a patch and is waiting on dev branch to check it in.
~
o [NSE] Resolve ssh2.lua buffering problems
  (http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0673.html) [Joao]
~
o Decide what to do about ncat source code headers -- maybe just use
  the Nmap ones. [David added the Nmap headers]
~
o Once we go into deep stability freeze mode, create an nmap-exp
  development branches for changes we plan to integrate after the
  stable release. [Fyodor]
~
o Update CHANGELOG for latest changes [Fyodor]
~
o Release 4.85BETA10
~
o [NSE] Open proxy detection scripts
  o We have http-open-proxy.nse, but we should probably either extrand
  that to handle other types of proxies (such as SOCKS and HTTP
  CONNECT) or create more scripts to handle those other proxy
  types. [Joao, David]
  o Joao has written scripts, just need to finish up, evaluate, integrate.
~
o Determine whether zenmap.spec.in can currently require
  "python-sqlite" rather than "python-sqlite2", or if it at least can
  be easily made to do so. The former seems more compatible since
  RHEL/CentOS 5.3 has a "python-sqlite" package, but not
  "python-sqlite2".  Meanwhile, Fedora 10 provides the "python-sqlite"
  capability as long as you have the Python 2.5 package installed
  (python-2.5.2-1.fc10).  Fedora 10 does also make a
  python-sqlite2 package available.
~
o [Ncat] Solve EOF issues which crop up when piping to an external
  command. See http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0528.html. It
  sounds like we will go with Daniel's patch [Daniel, David]
~
o Look into building RPMs with SSL support. Statically linking to
  OpenSSL on Linux for the RPMs didn't work for me last time I
  tried. [Fyodor]
  o Static linking of Nmap to OpenSSL does not seem to work on Fedora
    10 or CentOS 5.3.  The problem appears to relate to the OpenSSL
    krb5 support.
  o Could build my own OpenSSL libraries on the build system
    (w/o Kerberos support) and link to those.
  o At some point, we might want to consider including OpenSSL with
    Nmap tarball.  The problem is that it is rather big.  Would
    increase Nmap .tar.bz2 size from about 9 megs to about 12.  OTOH,
    OpenSSL is only going to get more and more important.  Maybe we
    can include a stripped down version?
  o If we don't integrate OpenSSL (or until we do), we might consider
    a more prominent configure warning for when SSL is not detected.
    We could suggest that users run "yum install libopenssl-devel" or
    "apt-get install libssl-dev" commands or whatever is appropriate
    and then reconfigure.  Or we could point them to a page or
    nmap-dev posting URL with instructions.
~
o Figure out why I [Fyodor] get a bunch of "Operation not permitted" errors
when I launch a scan on SYN such as: 
  - I'm going to ignore this for now unless it causes me trouble
  again, as this is an old machine that will be replaced soon anyway.
  And we haven't been hearing of the problems from others lately.

   May be related to connection tracking and high scan rates. See
   http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q4/0652.html
   http://www.shorewall.net/FAQ.htm#faq26
   Others have reported similar issues even without connection tracking.  See
   http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2006/q3/0277.html
   http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2007/q2/0292.html
~
break;
o -PO1 and "-sO -p1" seem to send ICMP ping packets with an ICMP ID
  field of 0, which we found that a small percentage of hosts drop
  (61.13% responded with 0, 62% with a random value).  So we might as
  well randomize them in these cases. [Josh Marlow]
~
o Some of the -PS443 scans (and maybe other ones) we've been running
  have been missing the Nmap line telling how many packets were
  sent/received, even though we had verbose mode. [David/Josh]
~
o Deal with Ncat newline problem.  See this thread:
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0325.html [David,Jah]
~
o Integrate SCTP scanning support.  See Daniel Roethlisberger's branch
  in nmap-exp/daniel/nmap-sctp.  As of 4/30/09, he is nearing
  completion.  See http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0270.html.
~
o [NSE] Release mutexes upon script death to prevent certain deadlocks
  [Patrick, David]
~
o Consider whether to let Zenmap Topology graph export the images to
  svg/png/etc.  Also think about printing.  Note that João Medeiros
  has written a Umit patch to do this: [Joao, David]
  http://trac.umitproject.org/ticket/316.
  - Now he has Nmap patch:
    http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0409.html
  - Consider integrating.
  - Integrated!
~
o Ensure that when I build a distribution package on UNIX (e.g. make
  distro), it builds what is in the Nmap directory I am calling it
  from rather than a particular SVN version.  I'm going to start
  building packages from a special "clean" directory which is
  different than the one I do development work in.  Also, I want to be
  sure that any changes in that dir are included in the release, even
  if they aren't check in yet. [Fyodor]
~
o Nmap UNIX distro build script should regenerate script.db. [Fyodor]
 o Now it is in make prerelease
~
o Nmap build system should be split into [Fyodor]
 o prerelease -> generates version files, man pages, script.db
   etc. That has to be done on one system, and then results checked in
   before doing a make release.  It does this stuff based on the
   directory it is run in rather than some set dirname or a pure SVN
   version
 o release-tarballs -> does any system-dependent building and creates
   the source tarballs.  It does this stuff based on the directory it
   is run in rather than some set dirname or a pure SVN version
 o release-rpms -> Same as above, but also uses the created tarballs
   to build the Linux RPM binaries for the current platform based on the
   tarballs.
~
o Build x86 and x86-64 VM instances for RPM building. [Fyodor]
 * I think I'll use CentOS 5.3
~
o [NSE] Script scanning does not seem to work on Fyodor's Linux
  machines after being installed from latest SVN (or 4.85BETA9) and run
  as a non-root user (it works fine as root).  The command "nmap -sC
  localhost" leads to NSE failure messages which differ based on the
  exact version run. [Was a relatively simple permissions problem in
  our Makefile.in -- I fixed it]
~
o [NSE] Release socket locks on connection failure or
  timeout. [Patrick]
~
o Update Nmap entry on Linux Online -
  http://www.linux.org/apps/AppId_1979.html
  - Screw it, the site does not seem to be maintained at all.  They
  aren't taking updates as of 6/2/09, and even Firefox shows latest
  update as 0.9.1.
~
o [Ncat] In verbose mode, print when an SSL connection is established
  successfully and give the leaf certificate hash to make it easier to
  verify when connecting to a machine where you can't or don't want to
  use --ssl-verify (e.g. connecting to an ncat ssl server where it
  created its own key).  While we're at it, we might want to print
  some other information from the leaf node, such as organizationName
  and maybe localityName, countryName or something.  We don't want to
  be too verbose, but 1 line would be great and 2-3 might be
  acceptable. [David]
~
o Fix NSEdoc to better escape single-quotes in fields.  If we can't do
  that for some reason, we need to document it better.  For example,
  when we initially tried generating nsedoc for
  http-webdav-unicode-bypass.nse, NSEdoc was listing it as a module
  named "s auxiliary module", apparently because this line exited in
  the description field:
  This module is based on Metasplit's auxiliary module, modules/auxiliary/scanner/http/wmap_dir_webdav_unicode_bypass.rb. 
  (For full example, see scripts/http-webdav-unicode-bypass.nse
  r13345) [David/SoC]
~
o --script-args should allow a wider range of characters, and should
  give a more useful error message if it receives chars it really
  can't handle for some reason.  For an example, try
  "--script-args=smbuser=admin,smbpass=pass^word".  For more details,
  see Ron's report at
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0378.html.
~
o [Ncat] Have --ssl-cert and --ssl-key send a certificate in connect
  mode so that client certificate auth can be done. [David/Venkat]
~
o Once we're done with host discovery empirical research, add it to
  host-discovery.xml.  Would be great to show the best combinations to
  use for a given number of probes, the efficiency of the common probes
  by themselves, etc.
~
o Consider making the ping scan default be more comprehensive.  Note
  that I got 23% more Internet boxes found out of a 50K sample (see host
  enumeration chapter of my book for details).  Maybe I should
  experiment a bit more to ensure they are real boxes and not network
  artifacts and figure out exactly which tests are helping the most.
  If I do this change, I'll have to update the host enumeration
  chapter.  For UDP probing purposes, we should test whether including
  extra data in the packet (e.g. --data-length) helps in general, and
  for services such as 53 and 137, we should probably send proper
  protocol headers (e.g. a DNS server status message) so that we
  receive responses from listening services.
~
o We should probably check for a system Lua in a "lua5.1" directory
  rather than just "lua", as Debian and also my Fedora 10 systems seem
  to have that.  See
  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=527997. [Note,
  Fyodor asked the bug reporter Jan Nordholz on 5/14/09 if he could
  write a patch. Jan sent in a patch, it worked, Fyodor checked it in.]
~
o [NSE] Get rid of ceil so that floating point NSE runlevels work
  again (some scripts, including (smb-brute) rely on this.  They got
  broken with the NSE core lua rewrite. [David].
~
o NSE script logical operator stuff is now documented in
  scripting.xml--add to refguide.xml as well. [David/Patrick]
~
o [NSE] Correct nsock_connect to unlock the socket slot if the
  connection fails.  When a socket is closed, it is unlocked so the
  arbitrator can potentially open up a socket for another thread. But
  Patrick discovered that a socket is not automatically unlocked when
  a connection fails or times out, only when it is closed
  explicitly. So that could hold up socket allocation for other
  threads until garbage collection.  May be a cause of slowness or
  possibly deadlocks. [Patrick]
~
o [NSE] Solve segfault issue which occurs when Nsock events call back
  on a thread that has already ended (e.g. timeout, crash, early exit,
  whatever) and been garbage collected.  May want to just nsi_delete
  all nsock sockets immediately upon thread ending.  For an example of
  this type of segfault, see
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0289.html. David says " I think
  in the interests of getting this in a stable release, we should use
  that strategy of closing all a thread's sockets. That ought to fix
  all the problems above.  Not to rule out a more thoughtful redesign
  in the future." [David,Patrick]
~
o We added the SEQ.CI value in Feb 2009 with 0 matchpoints.  At some
  point (once we have some real-life values) we need to evaluate whether
  we want to give it points.  A good time to do that would be when we
  next do fingerprint integration, so we will actually have examples
  of .CI in the nmap-os-db. [David]
~
o [NSE] Make it a warning rather than error if a script in script.db
   can't be found. [Patrick]
~
o Add version detection signature for Ncat chat once we finalize the
  announce format. [David]
~
o Change Nmap signature files to use the .sig extension rather than
  .gpg.txt, as that seems to be what gpg recommends.  In fact, gpg
  will automatically verify the right file if it exists after dropping
  the .sig (or .asc) extension.  I may need to configure .htaccess to
  serve .sig files properly.  Update nmap-install.xml
  accordingly. Suggested by tic at eternalrealm.net by email on
  7/13/08. [Fyodor]
  * Rename existing files, add symlink from the old .gpg.txt to .asc
    versions
  * Add appropriate .htaccess content type if needed for downloads
   - not needed since I decided on .asc extension rather than .sig
  * Update the generation scripts
  * Update the book documentation -
    https://nmap.org/book/install.html#inst-integrity
~
o Ask Coverity if they'll scan latest version of Nmap. [Fyodor asked
  David Maxwell on 5/14/09 ]
~
o Make 4.85BETA9 release [Fyodor]
~
o [Zenmap] Make a way to start a scan from the profile editor without
  creating a profile, then remove the command wizard.  This is partial
  implementation of
  http://www.bamsoftware.com/wiki/Nmap/ZenmapCommandLine. [David]
~
o [Ncat] Make proxy server mode work on Windows (this is the last
  remaining fork() dependency in Ncat).
~
o Do an OS detection integration run -- last was based on
  1/8/09. [David]
~
o [Ncat] Maybe we should create an SSL cert with no passphrase during
  Ncat compilation or install process so that if someone specifies
  Ncat -l and --ssl with no --ssl-cert and --ssl-key, we already have
  one for them, and it is a slightly better one (since the private key
  isn't known) than if we distributed a key.  Obviously it is still
  subject to MITM attacks since there is no domain validation going
  on.  But people who need that will have to buy a key from a
  certificate authority in any case.  We could create the key by using
  the "openssl" command line tool as shown in
  https://nmap.org/ncat/guide/ncat-advanced.html#ncat-ssl, or maybe
  better to have a way for ncat to do it using openssl calls. [David]
~
o [Zenmap] Should probably give some sort of widget indication that a
  scan is running.  Now that we can start multiple scans at once, the
  "scan" button goes back to being unpressed while the scan is
  running.  As some scans take minutes or more to show output, it is
  not always clear whether they are still properly running.  We should
  probably have some sort of widget, such as the throbber used in web
  browsers, to show that Nmap is still running.  It could be fore a
  specific scan (kind of like how you have a separate throbber for
  each tab on a web browser), or a global one which means at least one
  scan is running.  Or maybe a different sort of indication is in
  order (like a timer). [David]
~
o Further investigate Nmap Proxy patch by Zoltan Panczel and Ferenc
  Spala.  See http://nmap-dev.fw.hu/ and
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0255.html . [Discussed it and
  then added new proxy feature item]
~
o Wherever practical, fix compiler warnings when compiling Nmap with
  VC++ 2008 Express SP1 (there aren't many). [David]
~
o [NSE] Consider adding boolean expressions to --script arguments.  For
  example, see Patrick's implementation at
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0300.html .
~
o Generate a list of trusted SSL certificates to ship with Ncat (by
  extracting f rom Mozilla or similar), and install them with
  Ncat. Decide how these certificat es should be preferred to any
  system-provided certs, if any. [David]
~
o [NSE] Add desired SoC09 infrastructure ideas to this TODO to the
  extent they don't already exist.
~
o [Ncat] Consider supporting server certificate verification when used
  in client SSL mode.
  o For now we document in user's guide that it is not secure.
  o Maybe we can do an ssh-style approach where we just print the
    fingerprint and expect the ncat client user to ensure it is the
    right one?
  o If we're going to verify cert's etc., we need to also make sure we
    are actually using secure ciphers.  We may need to update nsock to
    support cipher selection, because we want fast ones for version
    detection, but usually want secure ones for NSE and/or ncat.
  o Do we want to check all this by default, or offer an option for
    it?  Doing it by default is more secure, though it can be annoying
    when a certificate has expired, is self-signed, you connect to
    domain.com when the certificate is for www.domain.com, etc.  If it
    is done by deault, we might just print an error message.  Whreas
    if we have a special option, it may be OK to exit and refuse the
    connection.
  o What certs should we allow?  Same as the browsers do?  Maybe get
    rid of Comodo?  Maybe we should fail to recognize any certs with MD5
    in the trust chain?
  o What about people who are running their own SSL service and just
    want to specify the cert file they use, because they generated it
    themself and not from a trusted CA.
  o Need to check expiration, domain, etc. if we're checking certs at
    all.
  o We can probably get away with not doing revocation checking, as
    long as we document that we don't.
~
o consider changing status field from "up" and "down" to "online" and
  "offline".  Actually, maybe we don't want this after all.
  online/offline look pretty similar, and they're longer too.  I'm
  taking this out of the TODO.
~
o [Ncat] When acting as an HTTP proxy, we should support GET mode as
  well as CONNECT so that it works as a non-SSL proxy in browsers such
  as firefox. [David]
~
o Finalize GSoC applicant research, communication, and selection
  [David, Fyodor]
~
o Go through all the SoC applicants and decide who we want to accept
  and start communicating with them. [David,Fyodor]
 o Decide which applicants we want, and who would be best for
    mentoring them.
~
o Document that U1.RID gives "G" as long as all the data bytes in the
  echoed response data are "C" as expected.  This G code is still
  given even when the response is truncated, including if there are 0
  bytes echoed. [David]
~
o [Ndiff] Rethink the output format. David says: In particular, I
  would like to always have the old state on the left and the new
  state on the right: "was filtered, is open," not "is open, was
  filtered." I also like the context diff output of MadHat's
  nmap-diff. [David]
~
break;
o Canonicalize the "host up" messages for port scan and ping scan so
  that instead of things like "Host scanme.nmap.org (64.13.134.52)
  appears to be up ... good." we standardize in both cases on
  something like: "Host scanme.nmap.org (64.13.134.52) is up (.75s
  latency)".  Note the addition of the latency value, which is our
  srtt value for the host.  This will only show in ping scan and
  verbose port scan because the line doesn't appear without verbose
  mode. [David]
~
o Ping scans always seem to say "0 [hosts] undergoing Ping Scan" when
  you request stats, rather than the proper number.  For an example,
  try a command such as "nmap -iR 10000 -sP -n" and then press enter
  during the scan.  Here are some examples of the bad output: Stats:
  25:34:33 elapsed; 991232 hosts completed (72530 up), 0 undergoing
  Ping Scan Ping Scan Timing: About 53.69% done; ETC: 22:49 (0:00:09
  remaining) Stats: 0:01:10 elapsed; 0 hosts completed (0 up), 0
  undergoing Ping Scan Ping Scan Timing: About 24.03% done; ETC: 22:42
  (0:03:41 remaining) Stats: 0:03:28 elapsed; 4096 hosts completed
  (284 up), 0 undergoing Ping Scan Ping Scan Timing: About 3.06% done;
  ETC: 22:44 (0:03:07 remaining) [David]
~
break;
o Remove obsolete tests from nmap-os-db itself. [David]
~
o Prepare for Summer of Code
 * Brainstorm for ideas
 * Create new ideas page
 * Apply to participate in program again
 * Advertise for applicants
 * Evaluate applicants
~
o NSEDoc script/module documentation pages should probably provide a
  link to the script/module source code (except for C modules).  The
  link format should probably be of the form
  https://nmap.org/data/scripts/[script].nse and
  /data/nselib/[module].lua.  NSEdoc can assume they already exist
  there, as we'll probably put them there using the same system we use
  to copy other stuff to the data dir.
~
o [Ncat] Let people set up authenticated proxies using
  --listen and --proxy-auth together (right now we don't support
  that). [David]
~
o When you specify multiple comma-separated arguments to --script,
  those arguments seem to get lost when the Nmap command is printed in
  Nmap's output files.  For example, I run the command:
  nmap -oN - --script=discovery,intrusive scanme.nmap.org
  The output includes:
  # Nmap 4.85BETA4 scan initiated Thu Mar 26 15:40:05 2009 as: ./nmap
    -oN - --script=discovery scanme.nmap.org
  Note the missing ",intrusive" in the script argument. [David]
~
o Merge patrick/nse-lua-merge for easier-to-maintain and simpler
  codebase once David and Patrick are happy with it. [David]
~
o SVN check out /nmap as an external in a directory named svn or src
  or nmapsvn or something under nmap.org web tree.  Then redirect the
  individual nmap.org/data/ files, where needed, to the nmapsvn
  instead.  and update nmap-dev Makefile not to copy them to the
  /data/ dir anymore. Then update the nsedoc system to generate proper
  links to the new script/nselib locations. [Fyodor]
~
o Improvements to presentation of version detection
  information. [Brandon]
  o Allow longer strings.  Right now it can be 128 chars for the
    fullversion info, I think.  But that isn't enough for this useful
    information-packed string: "Apache httpd 2.0.52 ((Red Hat)
    mod_perl/1.99_16 Perl/v5.8.5 DAV/2 mod_jk/1.2.19 PHP/4.3.9
    mod_python/3.1.3 Python/2.3.4 mod_ssl/2.0.52 OpenSSL/0.9.7a)".
    After discussion w/Brandon, we're going to allow 160 chars total.
  o Instead of omitting all information when version info string too
    long, we're going to truncate and allow 157 characters, plus
    ellipses (...)
  o Brandon says: "my final gripe is that the full version string is
    constructed as <product><space><version><space>(<extrainfo>).
    but, even if product or version are blank, the spaces are still
    there"
~
o I need an output-autoflush option of some sort.  This could be
  useful to ensure I get all the --packet_trace and debug data before
  Nmap crashes.  Actually, I'm not sure that is so critical.
  o Killing it for now, not sure that it even is needed.
~
o Fix the directory function(s) in nse_fs.cc to be usable by scripts and
  improve flexibility. [this entry added by Patrick]
~
o [Ncat] The sys_wrap.c/.h code contains a whole bunch of capitalized
  versions of system calls (Fork(), Socket(), Sscanf(), etc.) which
  are mostly the same as the standard version except that they cause
  ncat to quit if they are triggered.  They also may be used partially
  for portability.  The main issues are:
   1) Because the function quits in the case of errors, it doesn't
      always have the context to print a useful error message (and
      even when it does, it often doesn't -- for example Fopen could
      print the filename, but doesn't.)  Also, sometimes these
      functions are called when quitting really isn't the desired
      outcome of an error.
   2) Some could be replaced by code in nbase, for example, Malloc
      basically does the same thing as our safe_malloc already used
      throughout Nmap.
  So we should probably consider simplifying/removing this code to the
  extent possible.  But we need to remember to add error detection to
  the callers where necessary rather than blindly switching from
  (e.g.) Connect() to connect(). [Kris or David]
~
o With --version-trace (may be a problem with other uses of nsock
  tracing too), I often get dozens of "wait_for_events" reports in a
  row in a very short period, flooding the logs.  For example, with
  the command "nmap -sV --version-trace www.google.com", I get:
  NSOCK (22.3570s) Callback: WRITE SUCCESS for EID 283 [74.125.19.147:443]
  NSOCK (22.3570s) msevent_delete (IOD #4) (EID #283)

  [Goes on for pages]
~
o NSE memory issues (and gh_list assert failure) [David]
  o See this thread: http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0532.html
  o We're taking this out for now since the new nse-lua-merge
  tenatively looks like it fixes this.
~
o [Ncat] Why does Ncat require enclosure in a while loop to answer
  repeated UDP queries, but not TCP?  For example, see the "Emulating
  Diagnostic Services" section of the Ncat user's guide.
  o Note: http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0133.html
~
o Determine what we should do about the IE.DLI OS detection test [David]
  o All of the 1656 results for this test in nmap-os-db are DLI=S.
    o Is the test not working right (producing the proper results
      against targets), or is it just a generally useless test for
      which virtually all targets respond the same way?
  o Are there other "useless" tests in nmap-os-db?  It is worth
    checking, IMHO.
  o We're going to get rid of IE.DLI, IE.SI, U1.RUL, and maybe TOS and
    TOSI tests.
~
o When you do ncat -h, Ncat should probably show the Nmap version
  number rather than (currently) 0.2.  Also ncat in -v mode should
  show that same header. [David]
~
o Ncat verbose mode (-v) should probably only give important messages,
  such as perhaps a message once you connect successfully to a port,
  or a message if the connection attempt times out.  An Ncat version
  banner (with URL) like Nmap has might be warranted (in verbose
  mode).  Currently, Ncat floods you with (mostly) useless debugging
  information like this with a single -v (this output, on the other
  hand, might be useful for a debugging option): [David]
  # ncat -C -v scanme.nmap.org 80
  NSOCK (0.0000s) TCP connection requested to 64.13.134.52:80 (IOD #1) EID 8
  NSOCK (0.0200s) Callback: CONNECT SUCCESS for EID 8 [64.13.134.52:80]
  NSOCK (0.0200s) Read request from IOD #1 [64.13.134.52:80] (timeout: -1ms) EID 18
  NSOCK (0.0200s) Read request for 0 bytes from IOD #2 (peer unspecified) EID 26
  GET / HTTP/1.0
  NSOCK (4.4280s) Callback READ SUCCESS for EID 26 (peer unspecified) (15 bytes)
  NSOCK (4.4280s) Write request for 16 bytes to IOD #1 EID 35 [64.13.134.52:80]

  NSOCK (4.4280s) Read request for 0 bytes from IOD #2 (peer unspecified) EID 42
  For comparison, here is what Eric Jackson's nc (The nc available in
  Fedora 10's package repository) shows in verbose mode for the same
  connection:
  # nc -v scanme.nmap.org 80
  Connection to scanme.nmap.org 80 port [tcp/http] succeeded!
  GET / HTTP/1.0 [David]
~
o Final polishing of our GSoC pages. [Fyodor]
~
o Advertise widely for Nmap GSoC applicants [Fyodor]
~
o [Ncat] We should (maybe) consider a way for people to choose
  usernames in --chat.
  o Removing this for now.  We can add it back if we decide we really
    want this.
~
o Deal with new Python 2.6 Zenmap build warnings:
  C:\Python26\lib\site-packages\py2exe\build_exe.py:16: DeprecationWarning: the sets module is deprecated
  import sets
  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2314799&group_id=15583&atid=115583
  [Bug in py2exe, will probably be fixed with a new version of py2exe
  once it is released and we upgrade.  This isn't causing us any major
  problem anyway.]
~
o When I scan large groups of hosts with OS detection enabled, I get
  groups of warnings like:
  Insufficient responses for TCP sequencing (0), OS detection may be less accurate
  Insufficient responses for TCP sequencing (0), OS detection may be less accurate
  Insufficient responses for TCP sequencing (0), OS detection may be less accurate
  Insufficient responses for TCP sequencing (0), OS detection may be less accurate
  Insufficient responses for TCP sequencing (0), OS detection may be less accurate
  Note how it doesn't even tell the relevant IP address, and it isn't
  included in an individual host section.  We should probably either
  include it in the section for an individual host, like we do with
  "OSScan results may be unreliable because we could not find at least
  1 open and 1 closed port", or (not quite as
  good) include the relevant IP address in the error message.  And we
  may or may not want to require verbose mode.
~
o Ncat chat should bomine the "already connected" user list into one
  line, like:
  <announce> already connected: 69.232.238.42 is connected as <user5>, 206.81.65.43 as <user4>, 69.232.238.42 as <user6>
~
o [Ndiff] Maybe Ndiff should display changes to version detection and
  OS detection information? [David]
 o Version detection done, now just needs OS detection.
~
o When I start ncat chat with this tcsh command:
  ncat -l --chat scanme.nmap.org < /dev/null >& /dev/null &
  The first client to connect to the chat becomes user0 and doesn't
  work quite right.  Messages user0 type get transmitted to other
  clients, but user0 does not see their messages.  Nore does user0 get
  the normal connection announcement upon connecting.  If I quit
  user0, the next client to connect becomes user0 again and has the
  same problem.  If I start ncat on the server with "ncat -l --chat
  scanme.nmap.org" (no redirection), other clients can connect with no problems.
~
o Ncat --chat should probably announce to everyone (including the new
  person) when someone connects.  This tells the new person their
  username, and lets everyone else know about the new connection. [David]
  o We should also tell the new person (and possibly everyone on the
   channel) the list of existing participants.
~
o SoC ideas page [Fyodor]
~
o Nmap 4.85BETA4 release [Fyodor]
~
o [Ncat] Wouldn't it be nice if we could support --exec (and maybe
  some sort of partial-emulated --sh-exec) on Windows? [David]
  o Almost working!  We found some problems with "ncat.exe -v -l
  --sh-exec "ncat -v scanme.nmap.org"
~
o [Ncat] Can we use it as an IPv4 <-> IPv6 gateway?  If so (or if we
  can add it), it should be added to the ncat guide feature list.
  o Yes, David tried it with --sh-exec and it worked.
~
o [Ncat] We should probably make it work without OpenSSL.  When I try
  ./configure --without-openssl on latest svn Nmap, Ncat build fails
  with:
       gcc -MM -I../libpcap -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -I. -I.. -I../nsock/include/ -I../nbase ncat_main.c ncat_connect.c ncat_core.c ncat_listen.c ncat_proxy.c ncat_broker.c ncat_hostmatch.c ncat_ssl.c util.c sys_wrap.c > makefile.dep

~
o [Ncat] Defensive coding review of Ncat --chat (talk)
~
o [Ncat] As SSL server it should not crash when someone connects in
  w/o SSL and does ^C.  When David tried it during our chat, the ncat
  servr "ncat --broker --ssl-key test-key.pem --ssl-cert test-cert.pem
  --ssl --chat -l"  crashed with: SSL_accept():
  error:00000000:lib(0):func(0):reason(0).  Also, when a Windows SSL
  clients joined and then left, the server died with "Broken pipe
~
o [Ncat] --chat should probably only allow reasonable chars, to avoid
  cntrl-chars, etc.
~
o Nmap should treat ports named "unknown" in nmap-services the same
  way (from a naming perspective) as it treats ports which are not
  listed at all.  See http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0589.html.
~
o Ncat user guide "Emulating Diagnostic Services" page has a very long
  UDP chargen server line which causes wrapping problems in web browsers
  (e.g. it widens the page substantially).  It should probably be
  split into multiple lines. [David]
~
o Ncat user guide proxying section says "The only exception is when
  listing a proxy host by IPv6 address; then the port is required."
  Why would we require a port number for IPv6 rather than just use the
  same defaults as we do for IPv4?
  [David explained that this is because to do otherwise would be
  ambiguous because IPv6 uses : for separaters, so we wouldn't know
  how to handle things like FF::10:80]
~
o [Ncat] Perhaps we should make --ssl work in --chat.  If nothing
  else, it might be useful if you want to reduce the number of people
  connecting with telnet, etc. rather than ncat.

o [Ncat] --talk should probably be changed (in the code and
  documentation) to --chat, as Ncat chat has a
  much nicer ring to it, IMHO.  --talk should remain as an alias to
  --chat, but we don't need to document it. [David]
~
o Ncat Windows issue where you make a connection and then take several
  seconds to type in a line to the server, Ncat wrongly times out when
  trying to write your line to the remote server. [David]
~
o Ncat write timeout problems cause client to quit due to write
  timeout sometimes. [David]
  Examples:
   o yes | ncat localhost
   o when we paste a few lines into the terminal window in an Ncat chat
~
o Defensive coding review of ncat_proxy.* [David]
~
o Process the latest version detection submissions.  We now have more
  than 1,700 of them queued up. [Doug]
~
o Write Ncat users' guide, demonstrating all the neat stuff you can do
  with it.  This should probably be in DocBook XML so it can be an NNS
  chapter.  You might want to query nmap-dev for list of neat things
  people do with ncat (or look around for what people do with nc).
  Testing it out for examples might expose areas for improvement as
  well. [David]
~
o Look at Dario Ciccarone's email from 5/1/07 about IPID sequence
  issues, and consider adding IPID sequence test for closed-port-tcp as
  they apparently can be different. [David]
  o Also fix bug which causes SEQ to not be printed if the TCP open
    port tests fail to produce results, even though the II and
    (upcoming) CI tests may have useful results. [David]
~
o NSE should offer some way to sleep/yield for a given amount of
  time.  This would allow other scripts to run while a script has
  nothing to do.  Possible uses:
  o Many services have rate limits (or you might just want to use them
    for politeness).  For example, a web site spidering application
    might want to limit HTTP requests to some number per second to avoid
    pissing off the target webmaster more than is necessary (or prevent
    getting auto-blocked).  Similarly, whois servers often will block
    IPs which query them too often in a short period.  Or maybe you
    don't want to exceed the threshold limits of an IDS.
  o Example current scripts which might benefit: sql-injection, whois
    (possibly), pop3-brute, etc.
  o If we don't currently have a way for a cpu-bound NSE script to
    yield, then perhaps this could help us implement such a mechanism.
    But maybe coroutine.yield already does the trick.
  o The mechanism needs to be documented, and ideally should be
    implemented in at least one of the scripts shipped with Nmap.
~
o Consider adding a way for requesting timing status updates at a
  given interval (such as every 5 seconds) to XML and/or normal
  output.  This would be useful for people who run Nmap from scripts
  or other higher level applications. [David]
~
o Ncat --allow/--deny bug: "--allow and --deny only support host
  specification by IP address, and give no warning when you use
  another form such as a host name." Should probably use same syntax
  as --exclude. We also want to at least do verification at the
  beginning to make sure all the entries are legitimately formed.  We
  probably want to do things like DNS resolution at the beginning
  too. Otherwise we might have a DNS failure when we actually get a
  connection and perhaps have to reject the connection wrongly, or
  risk a false negative.  [David]
~
o Fix this overflow:
  Stats: 93:57:40 elapsed; 254868 hosts completed (2048 up), 2048 undergoing UDP Scan
  UDP Scan Timing: About 11.34% done; ETC: 03:21 (-688:-41:-48 remaining)
  [Done by David and Henri Doreau]
~
o Ncat -- perhaps connection brokering should support UDP as well as
  (its existing support for) TCP?  Actually this does raise issues
  such as deciding what list of UDP systems to forward a packet too.
  Its obviously not like TCP where you have a list of open
  connections.  Ncat could build such a list, but, for example, would
  never know when to remove the host.  For now, David is just going to
  adjust the error message to encourage people to email nmap-dev
  describing their usage scenario if they want this feature.
~
o Ncat documentation should note that no SSL certificate verification
  is done (maybe we should offer an option to do so, if OpenSSL makes
  that easy).
  o Done in the new Ncat user's guide
~
o Fix dns-zone-transfer infinite recursion bug described at
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0317.html.  It sounds like the
  best approach is to use our dns.lua library rather than having
  dns-zone-transfer do its own DNS packet parsing.
~
o Fix XML escaping issue so that improper chars from NSE scripts or
  elsewhere can't cause corrupt XML files.  See
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0316.html for an example. [David]
~
o Look into whether we should increase the frequency of port scan
  pings.  See http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q1/0096.html . Note
  that Fyodor already increased them a bit in 2008.  Might not need
  more.  [David did extensive testing of this one already]
~
o Find way to document NSE library script arguments and perhaps have
  them bubble up to scripts themselves.  For example, I had to read
  the SNMP library source code to determine the script argument to
  specify the SNMP community name for snmp-sysdescr
  (https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/snmp-sysdescr.html).  Maybe we could
  just standardize on something like we do with SMB library and the
  scripts which call it (https://nmap.org/nsedoc/modules/smb.html,
  https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-check-vulns.html). [David]
~
o If it wouldn't bloat things too much, it would be nice to include
  ndiff in the Nmap win32 zip distribution files.
~
o Reported NSE crash:
  "Assertion failed - file ..\nse_main.cc line 314
   lua_gettop(L_script_scan) == 0"
  o He says: "After looking at this closer, it appears the assertion
    occurs if I include the IP where the scan is run from. For us, I'm
    running this on IP 57, which is a VMware Windows Server image.  If
    I eliminate that IP from the range it successfully completed the
    scan for all other devices."
  o Seems to be fixed.  He can no longer reproduce the problem with
    4.85BETA3.
~
o Deal with GTK DLL problem with Nmap 4.85BETA1: [Fyodor]
  o David's installer seems to work--he's using a different GTK
    distribution.  I'll try that.  Works!  Done!
  o Details on problem: http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0207.html
  o Quick workaround done for 4.85BETA2, but better solution needed.
~
o "SCRIPT ENGINE (250.600s): ./scripts/rpcinfo.nse against
  a.b.c.d:<port> ended with error: ./nselib/datafiles.lua:114: attempt
  to index global 'arg' (a nil value)"
  -- http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0227.html [Patrick]
~
o Consider making the TODO list public
  o Done: http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0175.html
  o Probably remove all of the "done" items since that is easier than
    reviewing them.
  o Might as well add to insecure.org/nmap/data/
  o Maybe a bug tracker is a better approach.
~
o [NPING] Fix compilation on Solaris.  See
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/870.
