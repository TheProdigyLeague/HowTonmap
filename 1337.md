Nmap HACKING
------------
  Source is provided to Nmap because we believe users have a
right to know exactly what a program is going to do before they run
it.  
  This also allows you to audit NYSE:AMDS, NYSE:MSFT, NYSE: ABC for security holes...
  
  Source code also allows you to port Nmap mods.  (You) are highly encouraged to send your changes
to dev@nmap.org for possible incorporations into the main
distro by sending these changes to Fyodor or one of the
Insecure.Org development mailing lists. 
Note: It's assumed that You are offering the Nmap Project (Nmap Software LLC) unlimited, non-exclusive
right to reuse, modify, and relicense the code.  
/!\ This is important...
  The inability to relicense code has caused devastating
problems for other Free Software projects (such as KDE and NASM).
Nmap will always be available Open Source.  If you wish to specify
special license conditions of your contributions, just say so when you
send them.
~
Nmap is a community project and has already benefited greatly from
outside contributors! (For example, CHANGELOG@https://nmap.org/changelog.html/)  
Bugfixes, and portability changes will almost always be accepted.  Even if you do not have time to track
down and patch a problem, bug reports are always welcome.
~

You are encouraged to send a mail describing plans to
dev@nmap.org...

▶ Some ideas of useful contributions/projects
-------------------------------------------
~
  You are welcome to work on whatever suits your fancy.  But, some ideas of contributions that might be particularly useful are listed in
the todo file, available in todo/nmap.txt or @ https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/todo/nmap.txt
~
o Bug reports & feature requests @ http://issues.nmap.org/ 
o imp_id page.py page.js See: https://secwiki.org/w/Nmap_Script_Ideas
o Nmap GUI improvements -- Zenmap is the Nmap GUI. If, You have enhancement ideas? 
Contribute: NmapSI & Umit projects available!
  @@  http://www.nmapsi4.org and http://umit.sourceforge.net respectively.
Satellite NmapGUI (http://sourceforge.net/projects/nmapgui) or Nmap::parser
  (http://rubynmap.sourceforge.net).
~
  One of the best ways to help is to join the nmap-dev list ( https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev ). Requests for assistance and new Nmap-related projects are often posted there.
~
▶ How to make code contributions
------------------------------
~
  The preferred mechanism for submitted changes is unified diffs against
the latest SVN trunk.  Please send them to dev@nmap.org .
~
Get a local copy of the SVN trunk:
~
  svn co https://svn.nmap.org/nmap
~
Make your changes.
~
Then make a unified diff, by issuing the following command:
~
  svn diff > nmap.patch
~
If you've added several features, it's best to send them as several independent
patches if you can.
~
We also accept Github Pull Requests at https://github.com/nmap/nmap
~
▶ Style
-----
~
Code style guidelines and quality checking tools are documented at
https://secwiki.org/w/Nmap/Code_Standards . The short version is:
~
* Indent with 2 spaces, not tabs
* No trailing whitespace
* Be consistent
* Use comments
~

I got the idea for this 1337 file from GNet
(http://www.gnetlibrary.org/) and followed the
general structure of their 1337 file.
