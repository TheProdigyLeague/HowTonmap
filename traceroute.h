* Generally, Nmap.exe is free for end users to download and use themselves *
* include Commercial Use from https://nmap.org *
* The OEM Edition is with more permissive licenses and special features for *
* this purpose. See https://nmap.org/oem/.. *
/!\
* (https://npcap.com) for packet capture and transmission. It is under *
* separate license terms which forbid redistribution without special *
* permission. So the official Nmap Windows builds may not be *
* redistributed without special permission (such as an Nmap OEM_license). *
* Source is provided to this software because we believe users have a *
* right to know exactly what a program is going to do before they run it. *
/!\
* This also allows you to audit the software for security holes... *
* Src_code|.exe also allows you to port Nmap to new platforms, fix bugs-- *
* and [+] new features. *
* [!] You are highly encouraged to submit your changes as a Github PR or by email to the dev@nmap.org mailing list. *
* for possible incorporation into the main distribution. Unless you specify otherwise, it is understood that you are offering us very broad rights to use your submissions as described in the Nmap Public Source License Contributor Agreement. * 
➜ Note:
/!\
* funding the project is by selling licenses with various terms, and also *
* because the inability to relicense code has caused devastating *
* problems for other Free Software projects (such as KDE and NASM). *
