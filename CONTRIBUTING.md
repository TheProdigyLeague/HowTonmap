â–¶ Nmap welcomes your code contribution in the form of a Github Pull Request. We will convert your PR into a patch and apply it to the Subversion repository.

  Send a notification email to [dev@nmap.org](mailto:dev@nmap.org) Reference: Include short descriptions of functionality-patch to Travis.yml \ci
Referencing contributions by PR number is more convenient than tracking by
[seclists.org](http://seclists.org/) mail archive URL, especially when the discussion spans more than
one quarter year.
